### **What is this?**  
This is a **living campaign wiki** for tracking your D&D group's adventures, designed to:  
- 📜 **Document campaigns** in three phases:  
  - **Before** (world lore), **During** (session-by-session chaos), **After** (consequences/legacy).  
- 🧙 **Catalog characters** with backstories, stats, and relationships.  
- 🗺️ **Track player choices** and their ripple effects on the world.  
- 🔍 **Preserve memories** of NPCs, quests, and inside jokes.
