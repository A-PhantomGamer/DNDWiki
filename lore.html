On the day of his brother's wedding to Tatyana, Strahd murdered his brother and pursued Tatyana until she flung herself from the walls of Castle Ravenloft.</p>
                            <p>In that moment, Strahd became a vampire, and the land of Barovia was torn from the material plane, surrounded by deadly mists that trap all who enter. It is said that Strahd is doomed to find Tatyana's reincarnation again and again, only to lose her each time.</p>
